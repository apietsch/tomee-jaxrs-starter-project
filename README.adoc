Run and check if everything is green:
----
mvn clean tests

This runs test and api requests/responses using an embedded tomee via arquillian.

Run on a real Tomee:

- Download TomEE plus 8.0.1 at http://tomee.apache.org/download-ng.html

Start tomee 
----
./bin/catalina.sh start
----
and see logs/catalina.out for ports and pathes.

In project dir:
----
mvn install -DskipTests
cp target/async-rs.war apache-tomee-plus-8.0.0/webapps
----

see log for the pathes:

or watch the different execution time and output of the maven test in target/surefire-reports/TEST-be.pengo.tomeeapi.AnyUserServiceTest.xml
----
<testcase classname="be.pengo.tomeeapi.AnyUserServiceTest" name="testAnyUserService" time="6.745"/>

----

The later anyuser/1 should take twice the time the asyncanyuser/1 call takes.
the asynchronous endpoint uses CompletableFutures to call the external jsonplaceholder.typicode.com api in there own threads (mostly in parallel) and also having a timeout of 10 seconds waiting for the external services to response.

If that 30 seconds limit is reach the endpoint will return a 404 Not Found.
See
----
be/pengo/tomeeapi/AnyUserService.java:97
----

It could be that the tests fail because the external endpoints are not reachable or also trigger the timeout.

To really point out the performance gain vs. the logic to achieve quicker responses all methods calling the external resources have
Thread.sleep() calls:
----
...
 threadSleepForSeconds(3);
 Response response = target.path("posts").
 queryParam("userId", userId).
 request().accept(MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON).get();
...

While running the app in TomEE or executing the tests, TomEE prints some logging on the console:
